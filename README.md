## Miscellaenous
To enable `gh-pages` to work without error, I had to update relative import paths in `node_modules/.bin/gh-pages` and `node_modules/.bin/gh-pages-clean`, which are copies of the same files from `node_modules/gh-pages/bin`. There is probably an explanation and fix that does not involve editing files in `node_modules`, but it is still rather strange.
